- graddesc.R: Multiple Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
- forwardselection.R: Choose a model to classify RNA-seq libraries into two cell types, running forward selection for 50 iterations. Perfroming 5-fold cross validation.
- Kmeans_part1.R: Implement k-means clustering for a given number of clusters.
- Kmeans_part2.R: Implement k-means clustering at random start points.
- PCA_part1.R: Projecting a 7 dimensional dataset onto a 7 dimensional vector
